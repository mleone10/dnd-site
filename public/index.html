        <h3>Features and Traits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Trance:</b> <i>(Elf)</i> Rather than taking long rests, I go into
            a meditative trance for four hours per day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Darkvision:</b> <i>(Elf)</i> I can see in dim light within 60
            feed as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
            light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fey Ancestry</b> <i>(Elf)</i> I have advantage on saves against
            being charmed, and I cannot be put to sleep using magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Incisive Sense</b> <i>(Pallid Elf)</i> I have advantage on
            Insight and Investigation ability checks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fey Presence</b> <i>(Archfey Patron)</i> As an action, cause all
            creatures in a 10' cube in front of me to make a Wisdom save against
            my warlock spell save DC. On failure, they are charmed or frightened
            until the end of my next turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Misty Escape</b> <i>(Archfey Patron)</i> When I take damage, use
            my reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60' to an
            unoccupied space I can see. Remain invisible until the start of my
            next turn or until I attack/cast a spell. Once per short/long rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Beguiling Defenses</b> <i>(Archfey Patron)</i> I am immune to
            being charmed. When another creature tries to charm me, I can use my
            reaction to make them make a wisdom saving throw against my spell
            save DC. If they fail, they are charmed by me for one minute or
            until they take damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Researcher:</b> <i>(Sage)</i> When I attempt to learn or recall a
            piece of lore, if I don't know it, I often know where and from whom
            I can obtain it. Usually this is a library, university, or other
            learned individual. The DM might rule that it is inaccessible or
            does not exist.
